\chapter{SmartIO}\label{chapter:smartio}
SmartIO is a solution for allowing the local resources of a machine,~i.e., memory and devices, to be shared with and used by remote machines, over standard \gls{pcie}.
%
SmartIO works for \emph{all} standard \gls{pcie} devices and their Linux device drivers, no special adaptation is needed in either hardware or software to make this sharing possible.
%
Whether devices are actually local or remote becomes irrelevant to the user, as SmartIO eliminates this distinction, with regard to both functionality and performance.
%
Furthermore, individual device functions of multi-function devices may be distributed to different machines in the network, or to the same machine should it require multiple resources.
%
It is even possible to \lgls{disaggregation}{disaggregate} a single device~(function) in software, and distribute it to multiple machines, should this be required by application software.
%
In other words, SmartIO is a flexible solution for scaling out and using more hardware resources than there are available in a single machine.


\section{Principal idea and challenges}\label{sec:idea}

    \caption[Devices are part of the same address space as the \glsfmtshort{cpu} and system memory]
    {Device memory regions (\acrshortpl{bar}) are part of the same address space as \acrshort{cpu} and system memory, allowing
    the \gls{cpu} to read from and write to device memory the same way it would access \acrshort{ram}. Devices can similarly use \gls{dma} to read from and write to \acrshort{ram}.}
    \label{fig:bus-enumeration}
\end{figure}
The defining feature of \gls{pcie}~\cite{spec:PCIe} is that devices are mapped into the same address space as the \gls{cpu} and \gls{ram}, as seen in \cref{fig:bus-enumeration}.
%
This allows a \gls{cpu} to read from and write to device memory in the same manner it would access \gls{ram}, also known as \gls{mmio}.
%
Likewise, devices capable of \gls{dma} may read from and write to \gls{ram} directly.
%
\Gls{pcie} also uses \gls{msi}, allowing devices to raise interrupts by writing to an address reserved by the \gls{cpu} instead of requiring dedicated interrupt lines.



This mapping to address space occurs when a system enumerates the \gls{pcie} bus and accesses the \gls{cfgspace} of each device.
%
A \gls{cfgspace} contains a description of the capabilities of a device, such as its memory regions.
%
The system will reserve a memory address range for each of these device memory regions, and by writing the start address of these regions to the device's \glspl{bar}, a device is made aware of the address space mapping.
%
Therefore, the term ``\gls{bar}'' is used interchangeably for a region of device memory.
%
Addresses reserved by the system for interrupts are also written to the device's \gls{cfgspace}.



\begin{figure}

    \includegraphics{ntb-example}
    \caption[Two computer systems connected using \glsfmtshortpl{ntb}, and the \glsfmtshortpl{ntb} translate between the two different address domains]
    {Two computer systems connected together using \glspl{ntb} and external cables. Host~1 has mapped segments of Host~2's memory through its local \gls{ntb}, providing Host~1 with ``windows'' into the remote system's address space. The \glspl{ntb} translate addresses between the two independent address spaces.}
    \label{fig:ntb-example}
\end{figure}



As depicted in \cref{fig:ntb-example}, it is possible to connect computer systems with different address spaces together over \gls{pcie} by using \glspl{ntb}.
%
\Glspl{ntb} can be embedded as a \gls{cpu} feature~\cite{whitepaper:Sullivan2010,url:LinuxNTB-AMD}, but are more commonly implemented in \gls{pcie} switch chips~\cite{whitepaper:PLX,pex8733}.
%
Using such \gls{ntb}-capable switch chips to implement peripheral devices, independent computer systems can connect with plug-in host adapter cards and external cables.
%
To the system, the \gls{ntb} appears as a normal \gls{pcie} device\footnote{The \gls{pcie} terminology for individual device functions is ``\glspl{ep}''. We use the terms ``device'' and ``function'' as synonyms for a \gls{pcie} \gls{ep} throughout this dissertation.} with one or more \glspl{bar} that are reserved and mapped during the enumeration process.
%
However, rather than being backed by device registers or device memory, the \gls{ntb} instead forwards reads and writes to its \glspl{bar} from one side of the \gls{ntb} to the other, translating memory addresses in the process.
%
The \gls{ntb} uses a \gls{lut} for address translation, which can be configured dynamically during run-time.
%
By using different base offsets in this \gls{lut}, it is possible to configure several memory-mappings (or ``windows'') into the address space of a remote system.
%
\Cref{fig:ntb-example} illustrates how arbitrary memory addresses on the remote system can be mapped, allowing the local \gls{cpu} to access remote memory as if it was local device memory.
%
Although address translation between the different address spaces is very fast since the \gls{lut} is implemented in \gls{ntb} hardware, the number of \gls{ntb} windows is limited by the maximum number of table entries.




As device memory on a remote system is part of the same address space as system memory, we can use an \gls{ntb} to map memory of a remote device.
%
We show this in \cref{fig:ntb-example}, where Segment~3 is allocated in \gls{gpu} memory rather than system~\gls{ram}, but still mapped for the \gls{cpu} of Host~1's similarly to the other segments.
%
By mapping all \glspl{bar} of a remote device for a local \gls{cpu}, it would be possible to perform memory operations on the remote device, such as reading from or writing to device registers.
%
Moreover, device~\gls{dma} is not limited to reading and writing to system \gls{ram}, but can also be used to access memory on other devices in the same address space.
%
This is known as ``\gls{p2p}'' in \gls{pcie}, and provides us with an opportunity as it becomes possible for a device to read and write directly across an \gls{ntb}.
%
We can use this to map memory resources for a device, be it \gls{ram} or device memory (of other devices). 
%
Furthermore, since \gls{pcie} uses \gls{msi}, it is even possible to map interrupt addresses through an \gls{ntb}.



As touched on in \cref{sec:motivation} and \cref{sec:problem}, the main challenge for our SmartIO system is to use the memory mapping capabilities of \glspl{ntb} to facilitate the use of remote devices in a manner that is \emph{transparent} to the \gls{os} and existing device drivers.

TODO: list up challenges
\begin{itemize}
    \item while dolphin's ntb solution is nice, we must still device a mechanism to blabla
    \item while memory mappings can be dynamic, addresses/cfgspace is at system boot
    \item while memory mappings can be dynamic, no communication overhead
\end{itemize}


TODO: see here and here and here for more details on PCIe and NTBs





\section{Implementation}\label{sec:impl}

%\paperref{tocs}{pcie-addr}
%Unlike existing solutions for distributed \gls{io}, SmartIO seamlessly combines traditional \gls{io} with distributed shared-memory functionality, and is, therefore, able to provide sharing capabilities at multiple abstraction levels.
%Devices may be distributed to physical hosts and to \glspl{vm} alike, and SmartIO also provides facilities for \glslink{disaggregation}{disaggregating} devices and memory resources in software.


%However, as resources are accessed over native \gls{pcie}, they can be shared and used by remote machines without introducing a performance penalty.
%%
%Also unlike existing \gls{pcie}-based solutions, SmartIO is fully distributed and avoids dedicated servers.
%All machines in the cluster can contribute their own local resources and access remote resources, even at the same time.
%%
%Finally, by using \gls{pcie} shared memory techniques, SmartIO is able to abstract away the physical location of devices and memory resources. 
%Memory addresses are translated between different address domains by SmartIO in a manner that is transparent to application software, device drivers, and even the \gls{os}.
%This makes it possible to provide optimizations based on resource locality and minimizing data movement, without requiring the user to be aware of the underlying PCIe topology.
