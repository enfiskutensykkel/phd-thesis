\chapter{SmartIO}\label{chapter:smartio}
SmartIO is a solution for allowing the local resources of a machine,~i.e., memory and devices, to be shared with and used by remote machines, over standard \gls{pcie}.
%
Our solution works for \emph{all} standard \gls{pcie} devices and their Linux device drivers, no special adaptation is needed in either hardware or software to make this sharing possible.
%
SmartIO is fully distributed and avoids dedicated servers.
%
All machines in the cluster~network may contribute their own local resources and access remote resources.
%
Furthermore, as remote devices and memory resources are accessed over native \gls{pcie}, they can be shared and used by remote machines with very low latency and extremely low computing overhead.
%
Whether devices are actually local or remote becomes irrelevant to the user, as SmartIO eliminates this distinction, with regard to both functionality and performance.
%
In other words, SmartIO is a flexible and efficient solution for scaling out and using more hardware resources than there are available in a single machine.

    \caption[Devices are mapped to the same address space as the \glsfmtshort{cpu} and system memory]
    {Device memory regions (\glsxtrshortpl{bar}) are mapped to the same address space as \glsxtrshort{cpu} and system memory, allowing
    the \gls{cpu} to read from and write to device memory the same way it would access \glsxtrshort{ram}. Devices can similarly use \gls{dma} to read from and write to \glsxtrshort{ram}.}
    \label{fig:bus-enumeration}
\end{figure}
The defining feature of \gls{pcie}~\cite{spec:PCIe} is that devices are mapped into the same address space as the \gls{cpu} and \gls{ram}, as seen in \cref{fig:bus-enumeration}.
%
This allows a \gls{cpu} to read from and write to device memory in the same manner it would access \gls{ram}, also known as \gls{mmio}.
%
Likewise, devices capable of \gls{dma} may read from and write to \gls{ram} directly.
%
\Gls{pcie} also uses \gls{msi}, allowing devices to raise interrupts by writing to an address reserved by the \gls{cpu} instead of requiring dedicated interrupt lines.



This address space mapping occurs when a system enumerates the \gls{pcie} bus and accesses the \gls{cfgspace} of each device.
%
A \gls{cfgspace} contains a description of the capabilities of a device, such as its memory regions.
%
The system will reserve a memory address range for each of these device memory regions, and by writing the start address of these regions to the device's \glspl{bar}, a device is made aware of the address space mapping.
%
Therefore, the term ``\gls{bar}'' is used interchangeably for a region of device memory.
%
Addresses reserved by the system for interrupts are also written to the device's \gls{cfgspace}.
%
For more details on \gls{pcie}, particularly how memory transactions are routed, please refer to \paperref{tocs:pcie}. See also \paperref{cc:pcie}.

    \caption[Two computer systems connected using \glsfmtshortpl{ntb}, and the \glsfmtshortpl{ntb} translate between the two different address domains]
    {Two computer systems connected together using \glspl{ntb} and external cables. Host~1 has mapped segments of Host~2's memory through its local \gls{ntb}, providing Host~1 with ``windows'' into the remote system's address space. The \glspl{ntb} translate addresses between the two independent address spaces.}
    \label{fig:ntb-example}
\end{figure}



As depicted in \cref{fig:ntb-example}, it is possible to connect computer systems with different address spaces together over \gls{pcie} by using \glspl{ntb}.
%
\Glspl{ntb} can be embedded as a \gls{cpu} feature~\cite{whitepaper:Sullivan2010,url:LinuxNTB-AMD}, but are more commonly implemented in \gls{pcie} switch chips~\cite{whitepaper:PLX,pex8733}.
%
By using such \gls{ntb}-capable switch chips to implement peripheral devices, independent computer systems can connect with plug-in host adapter cards and external cables.
%
To the system, the \gls{ntb} appears as a normal \gls{pcie} device\footnote{The \gls{pcie} terminology for individual \glspl{devicefunction} is ``\glspl{ep}''. We use the terms ``device'' and ``\gls{function}'' as synonyms for a \gls{pcie} \gls{ep} throughout this dissertation.} with one or more \glspl{bar} that are reserved and mapped during the enumeration process.
%
However, rather than being backed by device registers or device memory, the \gls{ntb} instead forwards reads and writes to its \glspl{bar} from one side of the \gls{ntb} to the other, translating memory addresses in the process.
%
The \gls{ntb} uses a \gls{lut} for address translation, which can be configured dynamically during run-time.
%
By using different base offsets in this \gls{lut}, it is possible to configure several memory-mappings (or ``windows'') into the address space of a remote system.
%
\Cref{fig:ntb-example} illustrates how arbitrary memory addresses on the remote system can be mapped, allowing the local \gls{cpu} to access remote memory as if it was local device memory.
%
Although address translation between the different address spaces is very fast since the \gls{lut} is implemented in \gls{ntb} hardware, the number of \gls{ntb} windows is limited by the maximum number of table entries.
%
More details on how \glspl{ntb} work can be found in \paperref{tocs:pcie-ntb}.



Since device memory on a remote system is part of the same address space as system memory, we can use an \gls{ntb} to map memory of a remote device.
%
We show this in \cref{fig:ntb-example}, where Segment~3 is allocated in \gls{gpu} memory rather than system~\gls{ram}, but still mapped for the \gls{cpu} of Host~1's similarly to the other segments.
%
By mapping all \glspl{bar} of a remote device for a local \gls{cpu}, it would be possible to perform memory operations on the remote device, such as reading from or writing to device registers.
%
Moreover, device~\gls{dma} is not limited to reading and writing to system \gls{ram}, but can also be used to access memory on other devices in the same address space.
%
This is known as ``\gls{p2p}'' in \gls{pcie}, and provides us with an opportunity as it becomes possible for a device to read and write directly across an \gls{ntb}.
%
We can use this to map memory resources for a device, be it \gls{ram} or memory of other devices. 
%
Furthermore, because \gls{pcie} uses \gls{msi}, it is even possible to map interrupt addresses through an \gls{ntb}, as they too are mappable.




\section{Main challenges}\label{sec:challenges}
Although \glspl{ntb} provide the fundamental memory mapping capabilities that can facilitate the use of remote devices, the challenge is to avoid requiring device drivers to be aware of remote-side address spaces.
%
As touched upon in \cref{sec:motivation}, this is desirable in order to use existing device driver implementations.
%
In order for a device driver running on a local~machine to use a remote~device, we must make sure that the driver uses addresses that is mapped through both the local and remote \glspl{ntb}.
%
For instance, when the device driver attempts to access \glspl{devicebar}, we must make sure that the driver uses memory addresses that are mapped through the local, or \gls{cpu}-side, \gls{ntb} without the driver or device being aware of this.
%
Conversely, when the device driver attempts to initiate \gls{dma} transfers or configures an interrupt vector address, we must find a way to transparently inject memory addresses that are mapped through the remote, or device-side, \gls{ntb}.



\Gls{dma} is particularly challenging in this context.
%
Device drivers may assume that any local memory address can be reached by the device, but as explained in \cref{sec:idea}, the \gls{ntb} only provide \emph{windows} into a remote address space.
%
It is generally not possible to predict in advance which memory addresses a device driver may use, yet memory must be mapped through the \gls{ntb} before the driver initiates \gls{dma} transfers.
%
Deferring the action of setting up these maps until the device driver initiates \gls{dma}, or some other time when the specific addresses of \gls{dma} buffers may be known, is not viable;
%
synchronizing with the remote system at this time will introduce communication overhead in the performance-critical path.
%
A naive solution is to map the entire system memory, but this workaround does not scale very well since it would require the \gls{ntb}~\glspl{bar} to be \emph{as large} as the size of \gls{ram}.
%
Not only will the memory requirements increase for every machine added to the cluster, but the number of maps supported by the \gls{ntb} is limited by the size of its \gls{lut}.



One possibility is to use virtualization to mitigate the complexity of managing different address spaces.
%
The fact that devices are on the other side of an \gls{ntb} could be hidden for device drivers by distributing devices to \gls{vm} \glspl{guest} instead of physical \lgls{host}{host~machines}.
%
The \gls{hypervisor} on a \lgls{host}{host~machine} can be modified to assist setting up necessary \gls{ntb} (and \gls{iommu}) mappings to the respective device memory and \gls{vm} memory.
%
This would make it possible to \gls{passthrough} a remote device to a \gls{vm} \gls{guest} running on a local \lgls{host}{host~machine}.
%
However, requiring that compute tasks run in \glspl{vm} limits the generality of a solution.
%
Virtualization is not necessarily appropriate in all circumstances, as it may add additional system load because \gls{cpu} cycles are spent on \lgls{host}{hosting} the virtualized environment.
%
A more general mechanism is needed for abstracting away the complexity of dealing with a remote-side address space without requiring \glspl{vm}.



The challenges for our framework are described in further detail in the papers.
%
Particularly \cref{tocs} provides a more in-depth explanation of the main challenges facing SmartIO.



\section{Implementation}\label{sec:impl}
In our framework, computer systems act as \emph{``\glspl{borrower}''} and \emph{``\glspl{lender}''}.
%
A \gls{lender} is a computer system that registers one or more of its internal \gls{pcie} devices with SmartIO, allowing the devices to be distributed to and used by remote machines.
%
A \gls{borrower} is a system that is currently using such a device. 
%
While a device only has one \gls{lender}, namely the computer system where it is physically installed, there can be several \glspl{borrower} using it simultaneously.
%
SmartIO also makes it possible for a system to act as both \gls{lender} and \gls{borrower} at the same time, lending out its own local devices and simultaneously borrowing remote devices from other machines.



Unlike other solutions for distributed \gls{io}, SmartIO combines traditional \gls{io} with distributed shared-memory functionality in a seamless manner.
%
Thus, sharing is supported at multiple abstraction levels:
%
devices may be distributed to physical \glspl{hostmachine} and to \glspl{vm} alike.
%
Individual \lgls{function}{device functions} of \lgls{function}{multi-function} devices may be distributed to different machines in the network, or to the same machine should it require multiple resources.
%
Additionally, SmartIO also provides software facilities for \gls{disaggregating} devices and memory resources, allowing device drivers to be implemented as part of distributed cluster applications or other \gls{userspace} applications. 
%
This makes it possible for several machines to simultaneously share a single \lgls{function}{device~(function)}.
%
It should also be noted that it is possible to \emph{combine} the sharing methods of SmartIO. 
%
For example, we can \gls{disaggregate} the device memory of a remote \gls{gpu} while it is being borrowed using the \gls{api}~extension, or we can share \glspl{vf} of an \gls{sriov} \gls{nic} with both physical \glspl{hostmachine} and \glspl{vm}.

The SmartIO driver abstracts away the physical location of remote resources, for both devices and software using SmartIO.}
    \label{fig:architecture}
\end{figure}


A crucial part of the design of SmartIO is that it is based on standard \gls{pcie}.
%
Not only does this allow commodity devices to be operated remotely by standard device drivers over native \gls{pcie}, but this design also means that the implementation complexity of SmartIO lies in software.
%
In fact, SmartIO can be implemented for existing computer systems that are connected using \glspl{ntb} in any network topology, regardless of whether the \glspl{ntb} are switch chips soldered onto a motherboard~(part of a ``system-on-chip'') or implemented as plug-in adapter cards.
%
\Cref{fig:architecture} illustrates the different software components of SmartIO and how they fit together.
%
In this section we give a bottom-up overview of the implementation of these components.



\subsection{Low-level NTB driver}\label{sec:ntb-driver}
SmartIO is implemented on top of the \gls{ntb} interconnection solution from Dolphin.
%
The low-level \gls{ntb} driver, illustrated as layer \textbf{(A)} in \cref{fig:architecture}, provides the fundamental \gls{pcie} networking infrastructure and memory mapping functionality which SmartIO builds on.
%
Individual systems may contribute parts, or \emph{``segments''}, of their local memory to a distributed, shared memory space. 
%
Memory segments in remote machines may be mapped into the local address space of a system by using the \gls{ntb}, as explained in \cref{sec:idea}.
%
Moreover, \gls{userspace} applications may use the \gls{sisciapi} to interact with the \gls{ntb} driver to manage memory segments and implement shared-memory communication.


\subsection{SmartIO driver}\label{sec:smartio-driver}
The SmartIO driver, shown as layer \textbf{(B)} in \cref{fig:architecture}, runs on all machines in the cluster.
%
It acts as an abstraction layer, providing a logical decoupling of devices and which physical machines, or \emph{lenders}, they are installed in.
%
Devices registered with SmartIO are assigned an unique identifier which allows machines to refer to a device without needing to specify which \gls{lender}~machine it resides in.
%
The SmartIO driver is also responsible for making \glspl{devicebar} available as shared memory segments, which allows machines to map device memory such as device registers.



Most important is the SmartIO driver's responsibility of mapping memory segments \textbf{on behalf of a device}.
%
SmartIO resolves the physical locations of devices and memory segments,~i.e., which machines they reside in, and map resources for a device through the appropriate \glspl{ntb}.
%
For example, a borrower can request that SmartIO maps a memory segment in the borrower~machine so that the device may use \gls{dma} to it.
%
The SmartIO driver will set up the necessary maps and return a \emph{device-side} \gls{io} address that the borrower can then pass to the device when initiating \gls{dma}.
%
The borrower does not need to know anything about this address, other than the fact that SmartIO has resolved it so that it maps through the device-side, or lender's, \gls{ntb} in order for the device to reach the memory segment.
%
This allows the user to remain agnostic about the underlying, physical \gls{pcie} topology, and rely on SmartIO to resolve paths in the \gls{pcie} cluster network.




With the abstraction this driver provides, SmartIO is able to facilitate the sharing and use of remote resources (both memory and devices) as described in \cref{sec:lending,sec:mdev,sec:api}.
%
By relying on the SmartIO driver to resolve addresses, a borrower may use remote \gls{io} addresses without requiring that it is aware of the internal \gls{io} address space layout of remote machines.
%
More details on how SmartIO resolves the paths between devices and other memory resources that must be mapped for the device are given in the papers, particularly in \paperref{tocs:lending-p2p} and \paperref{cc:p2p}.
%
This also explains how makes it possible for devices to use \gls{p2pdma} in order to read and write to memory of \emph{other} devices.


%Our solution provides a more general mechanism for abstracting away the complexity of dealing with a remote-side address space, without relying on \glspl{vm}.
%
%Using SmartIO, it becomes possible to distribute devices to bare-metal machines, while still allowing device drivers and even the \gls{host}~\gls{os} to remain unaware of remote address spaces.
%
%Nonetheless, \gls{passthrough} to \glspl{vm} is \emph{also} possible using our implementation.
%
%Furthermore, our framework is able to prepare \gls{ntb} windows in advance of use.
%
%This way, we avoid communicating with remote machines in the critical path, allowing \gls{dma} addresses to be transparently injected without incurring any performance overhead.
%
%With SmartIO, the hard separation between local and remote is blurred, as remote resources may be used as if they were locally installed and with native \gls{pcie} performance.




%without requiring software to be aware of the underlying, physical \gls{pcie} topology or the internal \gls{io} address space layout of remote machines.
%
%The SmartIO driver is able to resolve the \gls{lender} and 
%
%
%        %
%        Furthermore, our SmartIO driver also supports setting up mappings between multiple devices, even when they reside in different \glspl{lender}, allowing \gls{pcie} transactions between them to be routed along the shortest path in the cluster network (\gls{p2p}).

%        Device~Lending allows devices to be time-shared among machines in the network.
%        %
%        Remote devices can be dynamically added to a system while it is running and inserted into the local \gls{pcie} device tree of a machine.
%        %
%        When the system performs configuration cycles or allocates \gls{dma} buffers, SmartIO intercepts this and inject remote addresses in a transparent manner.
%        %
%        This allows existing software to use a remote device without requiring any modifications or special adaptions;
%        device drivers, applications software, and even the \gls{os} can use the device as if it was locally installed.
%        %
%
%    %\item[\gls{mdev}] Illustrated by arrow {\textsf{(2)}} in \cref{fig:architecture}.
%        %
%        The \gls{mdev} extension to the \gls{kvm} facilitates \gls{passthrough} of borrowed devices to \glspl{vm}.
%        %
%        \Glspl{vmguest} can access these remote devices directly, without breaking out of the memory isolation provided by the virtualization.
%        %
%        \Gls{mdev} makes it possible for \glspl{vm} to be distributed on different \glspl{host} in the cluster while benefiting from the bare-metal performance of direct access to physical hardware.
%
%    %\item[\gls{api} Extension] Illustrated by arrow {\textsf{(3)}} in \cref{fig:architecture}.
%        %
%        As an alternative to Device~Lending and \gls{mdev}, our SmartIO solution also provides an extension to the \gls{sisciapi} for managing devices and developing (distributed) device drivers.
%        %
%        This includes functionality for memory-mapping device registers and mapping shared memory segments for a device.
%        %
%        Our \gls{api}~extension makes it possible for device operation to become part of the cluster application itself, allowing devices to access shared memory segments using native \gls{dma}.
%        %
%        By relying on our SmartIO framework to resolve memory addresses between individual address spaces, a driver implementation does not need to consider the system-local address space of the machine where the device is installed.
%        %
%        This greatly reduces the complexity of implementing distributed applications, as it becomes possible for software to assume that \gls{io} resources are local, while taking full advantage of shared-memory capabilities.
%        %
%        Using this \gls{api}~extension, devices may be \gls{disaggregated} at the software level and shared simultaneously between application processes running on different remote machines.
