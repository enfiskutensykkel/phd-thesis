\chapter{Conclusion}\label{chapter:conclusion}
For the last two decades, we have seen that both machine~learning applications and distributed and parallel computing applications have become simultaneously more compute-intensive and data-driven.
%
Computing accelerators (such as \glspl{fpga} and \glspl{gpu}), \glspl{nic} capable of \gls{rdma}, and fast storage devices (like \glspl{nvme}) are now commonplace in most modern computer systems, ranging from embedded systems to distributed computing clusters.
%
This has led to increased demands to \gls{io} performance, as well as new challenges with regard to resource utilization.
%
In this dissertation, we have presented our SmartIO solution for allowing machines in a heterogeneous, \gls{pcie}-networked cluster to efficiently share their internal \gls{io} resources.



\section{Summary}
Short - what was the target problem?

What were the results?


\section{Contributions}\label{sec:concl}

How did we / do this answer \crefrange{obj:distributed}{obj:experiments}?
For each objective, state clearly how it was solved and how it helps solve the overall research question as well.
%
Also, objectives should be linked to contributions list in 1.5

How does this move the world forward?

\section{Future work}\label{sec:fw}

mention new NVMe kernel space driver here

security / safety

disaggregated memory - new interconnects

iommu in tree structures is a challenge - ats? other solutions?


scaling

%Our system effectively makes all
%hosts, including their internal resources (both devices and memory), part of a common PCIe domain.


%With SmartIO, the hard separation between local and remote is blurred, as remote resources can be used as if they were locally installed and with native PCIe performance.


%Using the \gls{sisciapi}, application memory can be exported as \glspl{sharedsegment}, and \glspl{segment} in remote machines can be mapped into a local application process' virtual address space.
%By building on these concepts, our \lgls{apiext}{extension} makes it possible for a device driver implementation to use all the memory \gls{disaggregation} capabilities of \gls{sisci}, while also providing functionality for abstracting away the location of memory resources and resolving addresses between different address spaces.
%
%A device driver implemented using our \gls{apiext} can be agnostic about the underlying \gls{pcie} network topology, as devices may \gls{dma} directly to \glspl{sharedsegment}, regardless of whether they are local or remote.
%
%It is even possible to map device memory of other devices registered with SmartIO, for example devices borrowed using \gls{dl}.
