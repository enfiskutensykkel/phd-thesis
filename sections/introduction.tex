A couple of lines stating the research problem

Moving data within a computer cluster is expensive in several ways, and cluster performance is a active area of research. In this thesis, we therefore address the resource sharing and IO performance challenges between computing nodes in a cluster, under the following research question: 
\begin{quote}
    Can we develop an easy to use distributed resource sharing system, yet efficient, low-cost, increasing the overall system performance, in a PCIe-based cluster?
\end{quote}
In particular, this research questions are broken down to the following objectives:
\begin{description}
	\item[\objective{lending}:] The framework should be able to efficiently and transparently share devices like disks and GPUs between machines.
	\item[\objective{performance}:] The performance of using remote devices in the system should be close to local access and native PCIe performance.
	\item[\objective{experiments}:] To prove real-world deployment capabilities, the system should be tested on realistic and relevant workloads and benchmarks.
	
\end{description}

%	\item[\objective{api}:] combine host communication and memory disaggregation with i/o, nvme driver
%	\item[\objective{performance}:] native PCIe performance
