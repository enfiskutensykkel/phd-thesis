\section{Problem statement}\label{sec:objectives}
The wide variety of data-driven cluster computing applications today rely on a combination of shared memory, high-volume storage, and hardware accelerators, such as \glspl{gpu} or \glspl{fpga}.
This has created a need for an efficient \gls{io} resource sharing solution.
%
However, while moving data efficiently between networked nodes in a cluster has been a research challenge for decades, moving workloads and data to remote units over the network remains a costly operation that introduces large performance overheads compared to accessing local resources.
%
In addition, \cite{Markussen2019}

Can a framework be created

	in order to meet latency and throughput requirements of modern, data-driven workloads?
In this thesis, we address this challenge under the following research question:
\begin{quote}\bfseries
	Can we develop a system for sharing and distributing resources in a \gls{pcie}-networked cluster, allowing cluster nodes to share resources with native \gls{pcie} performance,
	in order to meet latency and throughput requirements of modern, data-driven workloads?
\end{quote}

Moving data within a computer cluster is expensive in several ways, and cluster performance is a active area of research. 
In this thesis, we therefore address the resource sharing and IO performance challenges between computing nodes in a cluster, under the following research question: 

\begin{quote}\label{q2}\bfseries
	Can we blur out the distinction between local and remote in a \gls{pcie}-cluster by developing a system for sharing and distributing resources
	that allows nodes to share resources with native \gls{pcie} performance.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
    Can we develop an easy to use distributed resource sharing system, yet efficient, low-cost, increasing the overall system performance, in a PCIe-based cluster?
\end{quote}


In particular, this research question is broken down to the following objectives:




In particular, this research questions are broken down to the following objectives:
\begin{description}
	\item[\objective{lending}:] The framework should be able to efficiently and transparently share devices like disks and GPUs between machines.
	\item[\objective{performance}:] The performance of using remote devices in the system should be close to local access and native PCIe performance.
	\item[\objective{experiments}:] To prove real-world deployment capabilities, the system should be tested on realistic and relevant workloads and benchmarks.
