\chapter{Abstract}
Distributed and parallel computing applications are becoming increasingly compute-heavy and data-driven, accelerating the need for disaggregation solutions that enable scaling of I/O resources between networked machines.
%
For example, in a heterogeneous computing cluster, different machines may have different devices available to them, but distributing I/O resources in a way that maximizes both resource utilization and overall cluster performance is a challenge.
%
To facilitate device sharing and memory disaggregation among machines connected using PCIe non-transparent bridges, we present SmartIO.
%
SmartIO makes all machines in the cluster, including their internal devices and memory, part of a common PCIe domain, where resources may be used directly by remote machines, as if these resources were local to the remote machines using them.
%
NVMes, GPUs, FPGAs, NICs, and any other PCIe device can be shared with and distributed to remote machines, and it is even possible to disaggregate devices and memory, in order to share component parts with multiple machines at the same time.
%
Software is entirely removed from the performance-critical path, and our experimental results show that remote resources can be used without any performance overhead compared to using local resources.
%
Thus, compared to existing disaggregation solutions, SmartIO provides more efficient, low-cost resource sharing, increasing the overall system performance and resource utilization.
