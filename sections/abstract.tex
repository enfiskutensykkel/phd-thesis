\chapter{Abstract}
%Remote resources can be accessed directly over native \gls{pcie}, without requiring any software in the critical path or network protocol translation.
%%
%SmartIO seamlessly combines traditional \gls{io} with distributed shared-memory functionality, and is able to provide sharing and disaggregation capabilities at multiple abstraction levels:
%distributing devices to physical hosts, distributing devices to \glspl{vm}, and enabling disaggregation of devices and memory resources in software.
%%
%Furthermore, by using \gls{pcie} shared memory techniques, SmartIO is able to abstract away the physical location of devices and memory resources. 
%Our implementation translates memory addresses between different address domains and resolves paths through the \gls{pcie} network in a manner that is transparent to application software, device drivers, and even the \gls{os}.

This unlocks a new potential in PCIe-connected cluster systems, as application software no longer needs to be written with accessing remote resources in mind, but can be implemented as if resources are local.
%without requiring

%minimize data movement

%allow all host to contribute their own/local resources
%abstract away resources, blur the distinction. unlock new potential, in a manner that is transparent
%unlocks a new potential (for abstract maybe?)
