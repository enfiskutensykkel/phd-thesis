	\item[Abstract:]
	In this paper, we present a demo that utilizes Device Lending 
	via PCI Express (PCIe) in the context of a multi-auditory
	environment. Device Lending is a transparent, low-latency
	cross-machine PCIe device sharing mechanism without any
	the need for implementing application-specific distribution
	mechanisms. As workload, we use a computer-aided diagnosis 
	system that is used to automatically find polyps and
	mark them for medical doctors during a colonoscopy. We
	choose this scenario because one of the main requirements
	is to perform the analysis in real-time. The demonstration
	consists of a setup of two computers that demonstrates how
	Device Lending can be used to improve performance, as well
	as its effect of providing the performance needed for 
	real-time feedback. We also present a performance evaluation
	that shows its real-time capabilities of it.
